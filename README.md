# Command Line Chess

A very simple implementation of command line chess to help me get comfortable with ruby syntax and rspec testing.

Prevents players from making illegal moves, including:

* making moves not allowed by a piece
* moving a piece not belonging to a player
* making a move that keeps a player in check

Future improvements could include:

* alerting players when checkmate has occurred 
* allowing special moves like castling, en passant and promotion
